## Example

While we work together to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (also called COVID-19), some people might be tempted to buy or use questionable products that claim to help diagnose, treat, cure, and even prevent COVID-19.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the FDA is working with other vaccine and drug manufacturers, developers, and researchers to help expedite the development and availability of medical products – such as additional vaccines, antibodies, and medicines – to prevent or treat COVID-19.

Meanwhile, some people and companies are trying to profit from this pandemic by selling unproven and illegally marketed products that make false claims, such as being effective against the coronavirus.

These fraudulent products that claim to cure, treat, or prevent COVID-19 haven’t been evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness and might be dangerous to you and your family.

The FDA is particularly concerned that these deceptive and misleading products might cause Americans to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. It’s likely that the products do not do what they claim, and the ingredients in them could cause adverse effects and could interact with, and potentially interfere with, essential medications.

The FDA has also seen unauthorized fraudulent test kits for COVID-19 being sold online. You will risk unknowingly spreading COVID-19 or not getting treated appropriately if you use an unauthorized test.
