        &emsp;My name is Heondo Kim, I am Software Engineer at SmartSpace AI
        working out of Los Angeles, CA. Previously I worked as a data analyst at
        an insuretech company out in Santa Barbara. Currently I am developing a
        web application using Laravel, Vue, and websockets.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;My first hands on experience with web development came late 2019.
        I attended a local bootcamp and learned the basics of HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, React, and PHP. Since then, I have picked up React Native,
        Angular, Vue, Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL and so much more. It's always
        interesting to see how a framework deals with certain use cases and to
        try and pick up my favorite aspects of each when I start a new project.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-1">
        &emsp;At the moment, I am really enjoying using Vue and this website was
        built using Nuxt! The Vue framework and even Vuex is so easy to work
        with that ever since learning it at my current role I want to make
        everything with Vue. Nuxt is also fantastic, Laravel is fantastic as
        well but I'm not as familiar with PHP as I am in JavaScript
      </p>
