      &emsp;My name is Heondo Kim, I am Software Engineer at SmartSpace AI
      working out of Los Angeles, CA. Previously I worked as a data analyst at
      an insuretech company out in Santa Barbara. Currently I am developing a
      web application using Laravel, Vue, and websockets.
    </p>

      &emsp;My first hands on experience with web development came late 2019. I
      attended a local bootcamp and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      React, and PHP. Since then, I have picked up React Native, Angular, Vue,
      Redux, MongoDB, GraphQL and so much more. It's always interesting to see
      how a framework deals with certain use cases and to try and pick up my
      favorite aspects of each when I start a new project.

      &emsp;At the moment, I am really enjoying using Vue and this website was
      built using Nuxt! The Vue framework and Vuex was such a breeze to
      configure and implement. Laravel is also fantastic but I'm not as familiar
      with PHP as I am in JavaScript, but I am sure that will change with time.
